# A project to take Toast master experience online. 

## Game Rules


### Meeting Etiquette

* Attend meetings...even when you don't have a function.
* Be on time.
* Be prepared when you do have a function.
* Always stand when you are speaking for any reason.
* Always bring both your Speech Manual and your Competent Leadership Manual to every meeting.
* Pay attention to the agenda so that you are ready perform your function when called upon.
* If you are the Toastmaster, Table Topics Master, Speaker, or General Evaluator you are responsible for adjusting the time.
* No offensive topics/language should ever be used.
* Do not carry on side conversations during meeting.
* Do not use meetings to sell your products/services.
* Always show courtesy and respect to all members.
* When you are giving up the lectern, wait for the next functionary to arrive at the lectern and shake hands, then return to your seat.
* When a member has completed their Ice Breaker for the first time, we give them a Standing Ovation.
* If you are unable to attend a meeting just go to the agenda for that meeting and go to the bottom of the agenda and click on "Meeting Notes", then type your message in the text box. Then click on "Update Meeting Notes".
* We always applaud for every member who stands to speak for any reason and again when they finish.
* If you are a Speaker, get up and move to the front left or right of the room so that you can move directly to the lectern so that you can shake hands with the Toastmaster as you are being introduced. This small act helps make the meeting move forward in a timely manner. This also applies to the Toastmaster, Table Topics Master and the General Evaluator.


### Unwritten Rules
For Speakers:

* Don't say, "Thank you," at the end of your speech.
* Shake hands with the Toastmaster before and after your speech.
* Never apologize for making a mistake.
* Hands should be at your sides when not gesturing.
* Try to hold eye contact for 3 seconds with audience members.
* When giving a written speech, slide pages to the side. Don't flip them over.
* It's important to follow the times suggested in manuals.
* Confirm your assignment with the meeting Toastmaster prior to the meeting.
* Provide an introduction for the Toastmaster to read. If your club culture does not have your evaluator read your project's objectives (found on the blue box on the first page of each project in every manual) your introduction should include them. It should always include the title of your speech, and the last two words of it should be your name.


### For Toastmasters and Topics Masters:

* Take a seat during formal speeches.
* Try to avoid the three Bs in jokes and speeches: bedroom, bathroom, barroom.
* For Table Topics, avoid calling on members who are on the agenda for other functions.
* After a couple members answer table topics, give a guest or two a chance. They will find out it's fun!
